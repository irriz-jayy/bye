      <p>
        To my dearest Kianni . Like all stories there happy and unhappy endings.
        I thought we would have a happy one but alas we couldnâ€™t. I love you
        with all of my heart and thats exactly why I have to get as far away
        from you as possible.Were like an addiction to each other with equal
        parts. Both pleasure and pain. Fate just seems to come in our way. So
        lets cut the bullshit. Your too damn good for me and I know it. And
        somewhere in the back of my mind i always knew we wouldnt last and i
        think you did too. I know this may be painful at first but one of these
        days you will wake up and the sorrow will start to slip away. Until were
        nothing but a distant memory. Goodbye Kianni. Love Jay.
